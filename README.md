This project addresses the problem of fault and leak detection in modern water distribution systems using machine learning. Traditional manual monitoring techniques are slow, error-prone, and inadequate for identifying subtle system failures in real time. Using sensor and actuator data from the WADI dataset (iTrust, Singapore University of Technology and Design), I built supervised machine learning models to automatically classify system states as either normal or defective.
I trained and compared two classifiers, Random Forest and XGBoost, on precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Both models achieved near-perfect recall and precision, with Random Forest slightly outperforming XGBoost on false positives. The models were also analyzed for feature importance and sensor correlation to gain insights into fault indicators.
